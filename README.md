### Project Summary
- Implemented **Luby’s randomized algorithm** for the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem in a distributed setting using **YGM**, extending the shared-memory focus of the original paper to distributed-memory environments.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **parallel computation models** (CRCW, CREW, and EREW PRAM) and analyzed their impact on algorithm design and scalability.  
- Conducted **strong scaling** and **weak scaling** studies to evaluate performance across varying graph sizes and processor counts, highlighting efficiency trade-offs in distributed execution.  
- Explored **de-randomization strategies** by leveraging existence proofs: since a good assignment exists with positive probability, running multiple parallel instances or systematically exploring the choice space ensures faster convergence to exact solutions.
