# CSCE 626 -- Final Project

## Due Friday May 2 at 0800
* Progress update due April 14 during class

## Objectives
* Pick an algorithm of your own interest to study (discuss with instructor for approval). You could 
pick a known parallel algorithm and implement your own version for experimental study.   You could 
pick a sequential algorithm and attempt to parallelize it and perform an experimental study.   You 
could attempt to prove additional theoretical guarantees about a known parallel algorithm.    The sky
is the limit (with approval!).
* Starting April 14th we will have a mid-project update during class, approximately 3min standup presentation
* April 28th and May 2nd we will have a final-project presentation, approximately 5min each.
* Your final report should be written in a conference-style report due May 2nd.

## Project ideas (No pressure picking these ideas, can pick your own!)
* Max cut heuristic of undirected graphs
* K-core decomposition of undirected graphs (synchronous vs asynchronous)
* Outer Product sparse matrix multiply
  * see: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8327050
* Distributed filesystem traversal for large/deep directory structures
* Fully asynchronous SSSP (compared to HW4)


## Deliverables and Rubric
* 20 pts for your 3 min mid-project update (April 14th)
* 30 pts for your 5 min final project presentation (April 28th and May 2nd)
* 50 pts for your final project report (May 2nd)

## Final Report
*  Upload your final report and presentation slides to this folder as PDFs
